This is an Isabelle/HOL library for formalizing differential privacy in the continuous setting.  
It requires Isabelle 2024 or later.  

We plan to submit this library to the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/) 
The article for this library is to appear in CPP 2025 as a proceeding paper. [ArXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15386)
